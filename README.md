I am a self-taught developer looking for an opportunity to make the web a better place. Coming from a background in photography, I have progressed through UI/UX design into front-end development with a growing interest in other bleeding edge technologies. Over time I have become strongly involved in the open-source community where I regularly contribute and create projects, frequently attend conferences and follow other liked-minded geeks. This enables me to always stay fresh in finding the best solutions for technical problems. When I‚Äôm not learning or working on another blog post, I indulge my passion for jazz and funk music that helps me to maintain a balance between my virtual and real life.
